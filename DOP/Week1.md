You can make a list inside of a list by taking an item in the list and putting [] around it.

On a for loop you can define your function and use for n in range of list to print parts of the list

The while loop is not quite as good because the code adds 1 to n every time so if you put in 0 with will give you 0,1, and 2. While if you put in 1 it would give you 1 and 2.

For the Fibonacci you first have to check if n is under 0 then if its negative then if its equal to 1 or 2. After that you do (n-1)+(n-2)
