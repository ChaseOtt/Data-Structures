# Test Corrections
## Test 3
### Question 7
I chose answer A, the correct answer was answer D. This is because it will return the sum of all integers up to n

### Question 17
I chose B and C, the correct answer was C and D. This is because in the case of B it would see that 10 is smaller than 20 and would return 10 it would be correct. In D it would return 30 and not 10 being incorrect.

### Question 18
I chose B, the correct answer was C. This is because at the end it will see that 1 is positive and return positive even though there is also -1 in the data set

### Question 25
I chose A, the correct answer was B. This is because node B and node C must be completely blocked from each other meaning 4 lines would have to be cut and not 3

### Question 28
I chose A, the correct answer was C. This is because from years 1 - 5 the number of users roughly doubles however after it increases constantly.

### Question 34
I chose B, the correct answer was C. This is because in the case of B it has linear efficiency meaning it runs at a reasonable time, this means a heuristic procedure is not needed.

### Question 39
I chose D, the correct answer was B. This is because 31.2 would be a better estimate than 32.4.

### Question 41
I chose A, the correct answer was D. This is because in public cryptography a message requires the recipient's private key to decrypt

### Question 42
I chose C, the correct answer was D. This is because a 7-bit system could allow 128 items which is enough

### Question 46
I chose A, the correct answer was B. This is because A was an example of an asymmetric system, not a symmetric system.

### Question 47
I chose A and B, the correct answer was A and D. This is because D was correct, it sets bonus to 0 when the score is under 50, etc.
